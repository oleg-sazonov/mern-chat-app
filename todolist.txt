1) After new user Signed up (authorized) -> user can see Home.jsx. But as this user hasn't yet conversations we see toast with the message: "Could not load messages". But not every time.

2) Add sound of newMessage. audio unlocked (once) works with delay.

3) Problem with divider "New messages". If current user gets (for instance: 3 messages) and go to conversation with these messages current user sees divider above these 3 messages. But if user (sender) sends another one message, current user still sees divider above 3 messages but with new one message.

4) When I open browser, as an authorised user I see SidebarConversations as they were, when I leave the browser last time. And I need to reload page to see last updates as unreadedMessages etc.
