1) Fix the validation. On SignUp page it works good but it provides errors on Login page with unexisting fields: "Full name is required", "Gender is required" etc.
2) Fix the filtering bug in SidebarHeader input -> SidebarConversations. I need to search username or fullName but search by username and lastMessage.
