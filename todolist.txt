1) Fix SidebarFooter to get just Logout button.
2) Incorrect behavior. When one user logout and then another user login I've got bugs in SidebarConversations. After reload page everything becomes okay.
    * Conversations are not refetched after user switch because the store still contains the old list (length > 0), and selectedConversation is not cleared.
