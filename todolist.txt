1) When new user writes message to current user I've got incorrect SidebarConversation behavior. Component shows wrong info.
    a - wrong avatar;
    b - fullName doesn't exist;
    c - time correct;
    d - lastMessageCorrect;
    e - online/offline status doesn't exist.
    MessageContainer with this SidebarConversation also has incorrect data (messages). 
    ChatHeader conversation.name doesn't exist.
    ChatHeader avatarUrl isn't correct.
    ChatHeader isReceiverOnline isn't correct.
    Also, if I select this SidebarConversation and get a newMessage from this conversation, I've got it in MessageContainer but if I choose another conversation and then back to previous one I'll got the same wrong data in MessageContainer without lastMessage.
    If I'll reload page I'll get correct behavior and correct SidebarConversation as well as MessageContainer data. 

    // maybe fixed

2) After new user Signed up (authorized) -> user can see Home.jsx. But as this user hasn't yet conversations we see toast with the message: "Could not load messages". But not every time.
